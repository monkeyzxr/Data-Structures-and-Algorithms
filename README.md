# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Fun in with C++

These are some fun assignments of data structure.
All the codes are written by C++.

1. The code relates to single-linked list. 

Write a recursive function that prints the middle node of the list.
   
   
2. Binary search trees.

Insert a sequence of numbers in the binary tree.

Delete a number. (you will first search for the number, then delete it.)
 
 
3. Heaps

Make a heap of n numbers. You may print the array in sequence to show it is a min heap.

Interactively enter a number to insert.  After the insert print the heap again. 

Interactively delete. Show the heap after delete.

Repeat the process of insertion and deletion, alternatively 4 times.
  
  
4. Undirected graph

Implement a undirected graph with at least 10 vertices and 15 edges. Write a program to do

depth first Traversal of the graph.

The output should indicate:

The vertices

Edges of your graph (each edge is a pair of vertices).

Starting vertex of the DFS

Order in which each node is traversed in DFS.

Breadth First Search Traversal. The output should be same as above.

   
 5. Implement Prim's algorithm to find the MST for a graph.
 
Your graph must have 10 vertices and 15 edges. Give edge weights.

Your output must show the graph you created. 

The starting vertex of your MST.

Then you must show the sequnce in which the edges join the MST.
 
 6. Implement hash table.
 
You will store character stings in the hash table consisting of a-z and A-Z and 0-9.

The max size of the string is 8 characters.

The table should atleast store 100 strings. So accordingly decide on the table size.

Pick a hash function and program it - do not use a library.

Implement collisions as separate chaining.

Insert 20 strings.

Count the number of collisions you encounter.
